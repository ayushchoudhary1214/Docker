docker rename allows the container to be renamed.
docker run creates and starts a container in one operation.
docker rm deletes a container.
docker update updates a container's resource limits.

docker rmi removes an image.
docker rm containerid
docker load loads an image from a tar archive as STDIN, including images and tags (as of 0.7).
